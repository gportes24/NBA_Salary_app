            <h3>Background</h3>
            We began by scouring the internet for respected sources proiding information on basketball
            stastisics. We wanted to look
            at what information was available and how those datasets could be analzyed. German found
            NBA-Reference.com, a website providing
            comprehensive statistics spanning decades. Our first project sought to scrape, clean and render
            these tables into a SQL database.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>T  Questions</h3>
            
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>The PER</h3>
            The National Basketball Association has been in this game for a while - and understands the value of
            statisics. They have calucluated a score termed "Player Efficiency Rating" (hereafter PER), which measures the players' per-minute
            productivity.
            The considerations within this score is too complicated to discuss here however the scale is
            generally between 4 and 30 (the difference between a good high school
            player at low end and LeBron James setting the standard near the top). While comprehensive, the PER
            does not provide a lifetime judgement of the fundamental value of a player,
            but essentially, according to ESPN Analyst John Hollinger, "summarize a player's statistical
            accomplishments in a single number." And voila, a main component of our
            job had been done for us by those handy NBA officials. We could now get to work scoring the PER
            against other statistics and salary metrix.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>The Stats</h3>
            We calculated the salary contracted for each NBA player for the 2019-2020 season and
            cross-referenced them against their statisitics.
            These included points scored, blocks, assists, rebounds, fouls, minutes played and games played.
            Each of these provided additional
            context for the player's PER. Our Statistics webpage allows the viewer to analyze the salaries of
            players by team and their PER.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>The Starting money</h3>
            One of the keys to components understanding NBA teams is understanding the salary of a team. 
            Looking over a three-year move through their payments and the money they paid towards their 
            salary caps provides an initial understanding of how to break things down across players.
